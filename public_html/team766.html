                            <p>FRC Team 766 is a high school robotics team based at
                                Menlo-Atherton High School in Atherton, California,
                                a small town located next to Menlo Park in the San
                                Francisco Bay Area. We compete in the FIRST Robotics
                                Competition. Every year, we get 6 weeks to build a
                                120 pound robot that’s designed to fit a certain
                                challenge. Many of these challenges are based on
                                certain games, like soccer, basketball, or ultimate
                                Frisbee. After our 6 week build season, we compete
                                at various regional events in the area, for a chance
                                to go to the national championships. Generally, we go
                                to the Sacramento Regional in Davis, California, and
                                the Silicon Valley Regional in San Jose.</p>

                            <p>Team 766 was originally started by FRC Team 192, the
                                Gunn Robotics Team, in fall of 2001. Before the
                                creation of our team, there was only one robotics
                                team in the district, Team 100. The Wildhats are
                                located at Woodside High School, more than 5 miles
                                away, which made joining the team difficult for M-A
                                students. Initially, Team 766 took over the old metal
                                shop, which was being shut down as M-A shifted its
                                focus towards computers and the arts. Everything that
                                the school didn’t sell or throw away we took.</p>

                            <p>2002 was the first season of FRC that we participated in.
                                We didn’t do remarkably well or particularly poorly at
                                the Silicon Valley Regional, the only regional we went
                                to. In the Offseason we did win the Rookie Award and
                                Spirit Award at the Western Region Robotics Forum’s
                                California Robot Games, later renamed CalGames.</p>

                            <p>In 2003 and 2004, our team didn’t do much better during
                                the competition. We continued to go solely to the
                                Silicon Valley Regional, but didn’t make it into
                                eliminations either year.</p><p>By 2005, the students
                                who started the team in 2002 had become experienced
                                seniors, and had learned many valuable lessons during
                                the previous 3 seasons. Instead of only going to just
                                one regional, SVR, we also went to the Sacramento
                                Regional in Davis, CA. Their previous robots were
                                basically boxes made of extrusion (extrusion, also
                                known as 80/20, is basically an industrial erector
                                set). On those boxes they mounted various manipulators.
                                These robots worked, they just didn’t work that well.</p>

                            <p>The team went with a slightly different approach in 2005.
                                The team adopted a welded aluminum box tubing frame,
                                and a 6 wheel drop center drive train. The manipulator
                                was incredibly simple, just a long arm with a hook,
                                powered by a very geared down CIM motor, designed to
                                do one thing: lift and move giant tetrahedrons.</p>

                            <p>At the Sacramento Regional, we did incredibly well,
                                seeding highly for the first time in our team’s
                                existence. We advanced to the eliminations thanks
                                to Team 245, who seeded 1st and picked us as their
                                1st pick. Thanks to our amazing alliance partners,
                                Teams 245 and 1072, we won the Sacramento Regional,
                                our first win in the First Robotics Competition. At
                                nationals our team seeded highly again, and Team 245
                                picked us as their 2nd pick. With Teams 245 and 217,
                                we won the Archimedes Division, and advanced to 
                                Einstein Division. On Einstein field we won 1 match, 
                                and narrowly lost our 2nd two matches to the alliance 
                                that went on to win the world championships.</p>

                            <p>In 2006, many of the founding seniors had left, leaving 
                                a few experienced team members but mainly a large crop 
                                of inexperienced freshmen. At first, the team went for 
                                a design that attempted to accomplish all of the aspects
                                of that year’s game, which involved picking up and
                                shooting 7in diameter foam basketballs. The design 
                                ended up with some last-minute fixes to attempt to
                                make it to work, such as a rotating ‘agitator’ in the
                                middle of the hopper to try to fix some of the problems
                                created by the design.</p>

                            <p>The first regional the team went to in 2006 was SVR. 
                                Overall, the only part of the design that really 
                                worked effectively was its drivetrain, which was 
                                basically a copy from the previous year’s drivetrain 
                                in itself. However, the drivetrain (and defensive 
                                skills of the driver) was sufficient to be the last
                                pick at the regional, being picked by 254 and 581. 
                                The alliance went on to win SVR.</p>

                            <p>For the
                                Sacramento Regional, the team decided to take a 
                                completely different approach. They stripped off 
                                the ineffective shooter and clogging hopper, and 
                                replaced the weak belts with a single belt driven
                                by one of the leftover shooter motors, and adding
                                a more functional hopper. These changes were done 
                                on the Thursday before competition and took until 
                                Friday morning to finish, causing the team to miss 
                                its first official match. This match was lost.
                                However, the team went on to win all of the other 
                                qualification matches it was in at the regional to 
                                earn a #2 seed. The team was knocked out in the first 
                                round of finals matches, however. The design carried 
                                over to Championships.</p>

                            <p>The team did yet another reconstruction of the robot 
                                over the summer. The large group of now-incoming 
                                sophomores largely led the project to rebuild most
                                of the robot over the summer, incorporating a
                                hopper that worked with both a shooter and intake
                                from both throwing the balls in and picking them 
                                up from the ground. The design worked well, but in
                                elimination rounds at CalGames, the robot suffered 
                                a catastrophic failure to the drivetrain, knocking 
                                the team out of competition.</p>

                            <p>In 2007 the team continued many of the positive things
                                from the previous season. The drivetrain was largely
                                kept, with the addition of a two-speed gearbox. The
                                team went with a simple arm design for lifting the
                                pool tube game pieces. The season wasn’t hugely
                                eventful, but the team did make it to the finals
                                at SVR, edging out the team who had previously 
                                always won the regional and losing to a team
                                which would go on to win the whole year’s competition 
                                at Championships.</p>

                            <p>In 2008, the team went with a relatively complicated
                                elevator design to lift the large inflatable ball 
                                game pieces. The elevator itself was well-made and 
                                consistent, most likely partially because it was 
                                professionally welded. The design performed decently, 
                                seeding 7th at the Sacramento Regional, but nothing out
                                of the ordinary happened, except for winning 
                                the Judge’s Award.</p>

                            <p>In 2009, the crop of freshmen from 2006 was graduating,
                                and there was a whole new generation arriving, but this
                                time in the form of 8th graders (and one 7th grader). 
                                The team decided to pre-register for Championships. The
                                design was simple, and performed decently well, enough 
                                to seed in the mid-range at Championships.</p>

                            <p>In 2010, the previous experienced generation was lost,
                                and a few other experienced members of the team were 
                                left with the one year of experience of the new
                                generation. The team went with a small and relatively 
                                simple robot which performed decently once they ironed
                                out a serious bug with the USB hub at the
                                first regional.</p>

                            <p>In 2011, the team had one of its more successful years 
                                in recent past, building a robot with an elevator that
                                worked to lift the tubes to the proper height for use
                                in competition. A minibot, an aspect of competition
                                that year, was not fully fitted to the robot until
                                Championships, which the team made it to from the 
                                Sacramento Regional on an alliance with 1678 and 
                                1868.</p>

                            <p>2012 was a unique year for the team, taking a shape 
                                similar to that of 2006. On the initial robot design, 
                                nothing really worked. The robot could only effectively
                                drive in straight lines and balance on the bridges at 
                                the center of the fields. Somehow, this was enough to 
                                take us to Championships on an alliance at SVR 
                                with 254 and 971.</p>

                            <p>Over the summer, the team decided to completely rebuilt
                                the robot, complete with a brand new drivetrain for the 
                                team. The robot performed surprisingly well for barely
                                being finished the night before CalGames, but we won 
                                the competition. We were picked by 254 and 971, just as
                                we had been at SVR.</p>

                            <p>There’s some sort of trapdoor under the floor in the
                                room where the team holds its meetings. Rumor has 
                                it that it’s a Cold War-era bomb shelter from when
                                the school was first constructed.</p>

                            <p>When the school was tearing down an old building,
                                they were giving out pieces of it. A member of
                                the team managed to secure a fire alarm. It’s currently 
                                wired in, but not used, as a switch in the OI used for 
                                the 2013 robot.</p>

                            <p>In the closet, there is a pipe running across the 
                                ceiling. Various different pieces of robots from
                                the team’s history hang there:</p>

                            <ul>
                                <li>The minibot from 2011 (its own magnets hold it 
                                    to the pole)</li>
                                <li>Both kickers from 2010 - one of which is destroyed 
                                    because it was made with sheet aluminum too thin for what it needed to do</li>
                                <li>Minibot deployment arm from 2011</li>
                                <li>Replacement claw never fully built from 2011</li>
                                <li>A few destroyed wheels, one where the center area 
                                    (where the bearings would be) is completely separated
                                    from the (remaining) 5 spokes</li>
                                <li>Old pieces of shooters from the first iteration of 2012</li>
                                <li>A piece from the front end of 2009 which was first bent out 
                                    of shape and then reinforced by welding a thick 
                                    piece of quarter inch aluminum to the back.</li>
                                <li>The entire climbing mechanism from 2013</li>
                                <li>A drivetrain rail from the disassembled 2008 robot.</li>
                                <li>A set of retractable center drivetrain wheels
                                    from the 1st iteration of 2012.</li>
                            </ul><p>Upon winning CalGames in 2012, we were given a
                                Neato robotic vacuum cleaner, which works surprisingly 
                                well. We named it Boggy and he helps us clean up part 
                                of the shop and our pits at competition.</p>

                            <p>Often during build seasons and competition season,
                                the team plays a game called Blammo, non-lethal 
                                assassination with spoons. The general rule is each
                                person is given a target, and you can tag your target
                                if they don’t have their spoon or if they have more than 
                                one spoon. In 2008, the game was so prominent at the 
                                Sacramento Regional that it was mentioned that we didn’t “need to be spoon-fed” when awarded the Judge’s Award.</p>
